#+TITLE: Netlink FreeBsd Implementation
#+SOURCE: https://github.com/luigirizzo/netlink-freebsd/blob/master/README

* Code Structure
** *net*: headers
** *linux*: headers
** *test*: test
** _bsd_nlsock.c_: netlink sock dispatcher, derived from rtsock.c
** _genetlink.c_: generic netlink implementation
** _netlink.c_: netlink implementation

* TODO Figure out how to compilation process works
* Notes about building process
** _make buildworld_: compile the rest of the world "includes the kernel, core system binaries, libraries, programming files, and built-in compiler. "
** _make buildkernel_: uses the new compiler in _/usr/obj_ to build the new kernel
** _make installkernel_: allows user to boot into the new kernel

* netlink test program
** do_open: opens the netlink socket on the userspace side. Settings look okay.
** do_write: writes to socket

* Looking at code
** netlink.c
*** Dispatch table for different netlink handlers
**** bsd_nl_fn: struct that contains the different netlink handlers
**** bsd_nl_proto_reg: registers a new netlink family
**** netlink_receive_packet: receives message from netlink socket [Not sure where its called, on the kernel side?]
